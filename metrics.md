### Explanation of Financial Metrics

1. **Sharpe Ratio**:
   - The Sharpe Ratio measures the performance of an investment (returns) compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk (volatility).
   - It is calculated as the average return divided by the standard deviation of returns.
   - A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.

2. **Volatility**:
   - Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index.
   - It is often measured using the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index.
   - Higher volatility indicates a higher risk and potential reward.

3. **Maximum Drawdown**:
   - Maximum Drawdown (MDD) measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio value, highlighting the risk of significant losses.
   - It is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio before a new peak is attained.
   - Lower MDD indicates a lower risk of large losses.

4. **Sortino Ratio**:
   - The Sortino Ratio is a variation of the Sharpe Ratio, but it only considers the downside risk (negative deviation).
   - It is calculated as the average return divided by the downside standard deviation.
   - A higher Sortino Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance, focusing on downside risk.

5. **Calmar Ratio**:
   - The Calmar Ratio measures the performance of an investment (returns) relative to its maximum drawdown.
   - It is calculated as the average return divided by the maximum drawdown.
   - A higher Calmar Ratio indicates better performance relative to the worst drawdown.

### Improved Output with Interpretation

Here's how you can print and interpret these metrics in a more user-friendly way:

```python
# Convert history to DataFrame
history_df = pd.DataFrame(history)

# Calculate additional metrics
returns = history_df['total_value'].pct_change().dropna()
sharpe_ratio = returns.mean() / returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)
volatility = returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)
max_drawdown = history_df['total_value'].max() - history_df['total_value'].min()
sortino_ratio = returns.mean() / returns[returns < 0].std() * np.sqrt(252)
calmar_ratio = returns.mean() / max_drawdown * np.sqrt(252)

# Print the results
print(f"Total Test Reward: {total_reward}")
print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe_ratio:.4f} (Higher is better, indicates risk-adjusted return)")
print(f"Volatility: {volatility:.4f} (Lower is better, indicates stability)")
print(f"Maximum Drawdown: {max_drawdown:.4f} (Lower is better, indicates lower risk of large losses)")
print(f"Sortino Ratio: {sortino_ratio:.4f} (Higher is better, focuses on downside risk-adjusted return)")
print(f"Calmar Ratio: {calmar_ratio:.4f} (Higher is better, indicates return relative to drawdown)")

# Visualize the results using a plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(history_df['total_value'], label='Portfolio Value')
plt.title('Portfolio Value Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Time Steps')
plt.ylabel('Portfolio Value')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Detailed Explanation of Each Step

1. **Calculation of Metrics**:
   - **Returns**: The percentage change in the total portfolio value at each step.
   - **Sharpe Ratio**: Average return divided by the standard deviation of returns, scaled by the square root of the number of periods (252 for trading days).
   - **Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns, scaled by the square root of the number of periods.
   - **Maximum Drawdown**: Difference between the maximum and minimum portfolio values observed.
   - **Sortino Ratio**: Average return divided by the standard deviation of negative returns, scaled by the square root of the number of periods.
   - **Calmar Ratio**: Average return divided by the maximum drawdown, scaled by the square root of the number of periods.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Plotting the portfolio value over time helps visualize the performance of the trading strategy.
   - This plot provides insight into how the portfolio value fluctuates and highlights periods of significant gains or losses.

By presenting the metrics with explanations and visualizing the portfolio value over time, you can better interpret the performance of the trading strategy and make informed decisions.
